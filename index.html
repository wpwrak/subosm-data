      <BR>The subway system is complemented by regional trains (not shown)
	that mainly connect the surrounding metropolitan area but also
	have some stops inside the city.
	<BR>
	A vast network of bus services duplicates and complements the
	subway, providing service to the many areas the subway doesn't
	reach. A tramway line ("premetero", not shown) covers some of the
	southwestern corner.
	<BR>
	Note that the map shows a few stations that are not yet in service.

      <BR>Not entirely sure if all the stops OSM shows truly correspond to
	subway stations. Some seem too far out.

      <BR>I don't know that city. Is the map even remotely accurate ?
	The outliers seem weird.

      <BR>Subway coverage looks nearly perfect. Anything to add ?

      <BR>Vienna has tramways and urban trains to complement the
	subway system.

<P>
The color-coding is as follows: green is for walking distances up
to 333 m, which corresponds to about 5 minutes of walking (not
counting waits for red lights, congested sidewalks, etc.) A walking
time of 5 minutes or less is generally considered excellent.
<BR>
Yellow is for walking times between 5 and 10 minutes. This is still
convenient for most people.
<BR>
Red is for a time between 10 and 15 minutes. While still tolerable,
having to walk for so long may become an effort, especially in a
crowded or otherwise unattractive zone.
<BR>
Anything beyond 15 minutes (1 kilometer) is considered to be
unacceptable for the
majority of passengers (although some may actually enjoy a long
walk) and would drive many to seek other means of transportation,
be it in the form of a replacement of the subway service or in
the form of a complementary service to reach a subway station.
<BR>
Note: these figures are based on the meta-study
